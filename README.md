# Microcontroller-Based-Washing-Machine-Simulation-using-PicsimLab
A washing machine simulation built using PicsimLab and PIC microcontroller, demonstrating embedded system design and control logic. The project replicates real washing machine functions like program selection, water level control, start/stop operations, and safety alerts â€” all within a virtual simulation environment.
